# CEO Ticket Issuance Android App - Previous Session Context

## Project Overview
We are developing a TMA 2004 compliant Android application for CEO (Civil Enforcement Officer) ticket issuance. The app operates offline-first with sync capabilities and includes ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) functionality.

## Development Progress

### âœ… Phase 1 Complete - Core Infrastructure
**Status**: COMPLETE âœ…

- **Room database** with 8 tables (users, streets, contraventions, vehicles, observations, tickets, sync_queue)
- **Hilt dependency injection** fully configured
- **Repository pattern** with domain models and data mappers
- **Database populated** with dummy data (10 streets, 100 contraventions, 25 vehicle models)
- **Navigation framework** with Jetpack Compose

- `ContraventionSelectorDialog` - Enhanced contravention picker
- `LocationPickerDialog` - Street selection with search
- `DraftManager` - Form auto-save system
- `SaveObservationWithTimerUseCase` - Save observation and start timer

### âœ… Phase 5 Complete - Countdown System & Timer Management
**Status**: COMPLETE âœ…

#### What Was Built:
- **Countdown Interface**: Professional circular timer with animated progress
- **Timer Controls**: Pause/Resume/Stop functionality with state persistence
- **Notification System**: Rich notifications with progress and action buttons
- **Multiple Timer Management**: Batch management of concurrent observations
- **Timer Persistence**: Cross-restart persistence with state restoration
- **History & Logging**: Comprehensive event logging and audit trail
- **Alert System**: Multi-level alerts (reminder, warning, critical, expired)

#### Key Components:
- `CountdownScreen` and `CountdownViewModel` - Main countdown interface
- `TimerManagementScreen` - Multiple timer management
- `TimerPersistenceManager` - Cross-restart persistence
- `TimerHistoryManager` - Event logging system
- `TimerAlertManager` - Multi-level alert system

## Current State

### âœ… What's Working:
- **Complete End-to-End Flow**: Camera â†’ ANPR â†’ Form â†’ Timer â†’ Countdown
- **Professional UI**: Material Design 3 throughout all screens
- **Background Services**: Timer service with notifications and persistence
- **Data Management**: Complete observation lifecycle with validation
- **Multi-timer Support**: Concurrent observation management
- **Persistence**: Cross-restart timer and form state recovery

### ðŸ”„ Current Workflow:
1. **Dashboard** â†’ "New Observation" â†’ **Camera Screen**
2. **Camera** â†’ ANPR detection â†’ **Observation Form** (pre-populated)
3. **Form** â†’ Vehicle/Location/Contravention selection â†’ **Save**
4. **Auto-start Timer** â†’ **Countdown Screen** â†’ Real-time updates
5. **Timer Completion** â†’ **Completion Dialog** â†’ Ready for ticket issuance

## Next Phase - Phase 6: Ticket Issuance System
**Target**: Complete ticket generation and management

### Planned Features:
1. **Ticket Generation**: TMA 2004 compliant ticket creation
2. **Ticket Preview**: Professional ticket layout and preview
3. **Digital Signatures**: Officer signature capture
4. **Ticket Printing**: Print integration for mobile printers
5. **Ticket Management**: Issued ticket tracking and history

## Key Technical Details
